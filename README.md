# The website is made to show the projects from the Hello Series and the Flask Series
# If you click on the About button in the top right corner, it will take you to the reflections and self grading of Travis, Paul and Gavin.
# When the Journal button is clicked under Flash Series it takes you to the journal document of the first 6 weeks from Travis, Paul and Gavin.
# We used fontawesome to add the icons that link our social media and other medias for the consumer.
# We also used bootstrap to get a stlye sheet to make things work better and faster.
# Flask was used to make the website into an actual webserver to make it as consumer delverable as possible.
# The HTML code was used to add buttons, words, links and images to create a proffesional feel to the website.
# The CSS file, from Bootstrap, was used to get the right style, color, fonts, margins and padding everywhere so the website is nice and pleasing to look at.
